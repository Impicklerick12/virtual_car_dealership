## Halfway? 

So far I have laid the foundation for the app, asking the user for their name, providing menu options, and completing the order process. At the moment it looks as though it is running error free thanks to the handy implementation of the TTY-Prompt gem menus. To be honest I am happy with the progress so far, yet I still feel like I have a way to go to get the project to my desired expectations. I am struggling with adding a colour variable to each vehicle after they select it, and also provide an optional extras menu which will add to the total if purchased. I will persist though. This has been daunting, overwhelming, and incredibly rewarding.
