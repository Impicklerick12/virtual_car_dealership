## About the App

### Description

The Testla Motors app is a representation of an virtual car dealership. It is a MVP that allows the user to shop through different Testla models, customise them, and confim their purchase. There are also optional additions that may be purchased and added to the orders.

The app was created in a time of uncertainty, where a large portion of the population are confined mostly to their homes with minimal access to physical shops and industries. Online interaction with customers is critical, and a need has developed which allows people to shop from home with clarity and confidence. The Testla Motors app provides a platform where interested customers are able to browse the Testla models, view the different features, create and customize an order, and view any existing orders. All from the comfort of their living room!
